My approach to solving the eight queen problem.

Eight queens problem.
finding a way to put 8 queens on a board without none of them
threatening each other

This is an old code of mine. it was initially in sourceforge then
i decided to bring it to github. It is a cool solution :D

**Note:** It demands python2.
